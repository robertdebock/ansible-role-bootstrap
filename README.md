Prepare your system to be managed by Ansible.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
No preparation required.
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for bootstrap

# The user to use to connect to machines.
bootstrap_user: root

# Installed software to support modules flagged as "preview" (i.e. mysql_db).
# "yes", "no" or unset are valid.
bootstrap_preview: yes

# Do you want to wait for the host to be available?
bootstrap_wait_for_host: no

# The number of seconds you want to wait during connection test before failing.
bootstrap_timeout: 3

# The number of retries during installation
bootstrap_retries: 3
```

Requirements
------------

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml
- none

- ansible~=2.9
- git+https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git@devel

The indicator '\~=' means [compatible with](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release). For example 'ansible\~=2.8' would pick the latest ansible-2.8, for example ansible-2.8.6.




Testing
-------

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

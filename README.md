Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
No preparation required.
```

# "yes", "no" or unset are valid.
bootstrap_preview: yes

# Do you want to wait for the host to be available?
bootstrap_wait_for_host: no

# The number of seconds you want to wait during connection test before failing.

## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  # This role installs packages using the `raw` module and connects as
  # `root` per default. (`sudo` is sometimes not available before bootstrapping.) 
  # All relevant tasks in the role have `become` set per default to `no`, so you can
  # use either `no` or `yes` for `become`, the role will not use become (so `sudo`) for # any relevant task. Use `bootstrap_not_as_root` to override that behaviour.
  become: yes  # `no` will also work.
  # This role installs python, gathering facts can't be done before `python` is
  # installed. This role runs the `setup` module, so facts will be available
  # after running the role.
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
      # bootstrap_not_as_root: True
```

# defaults file for bootstrap

# Allow to bootstrap as non root ( e.g. vagrant user )
bootstrap_not_as_root: no

# Do you want to wait for the host to be available?
bootstrap_wait_for_host: no

# The number of seconds you want to wait during connection test before failing.
bootstrap_timeout: 3
```

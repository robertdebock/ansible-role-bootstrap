  # This role installs packages using the `raw` module and needs to connect as
  # `root`. (`sudo` is not available before bootstrapping.) All tasks in the
  # role have `become` set to `false`, so you can use either `false` or `true`
  # for `become`, the role will not use become (so `sudo`) for any task.
  become: true  # `false` will also work.
  # This role installs python, gathering facts can't be done before `python` is
  # installed. This role runs the `setup` module, so facts will be available
  # after running the role.

# Ansible Role Conventions

- Prefer readability over complexity.
- Split logic into Ansible Roles to allow composing a combination of roles.
- Ansible Roles do not solve business logic; they offer system logic.
- Playbooks can combine Ansible Roles into business logic.
- Ansible Roles need to be compatible with the distributions listed in `meta/main.yml`.
- `ansible-lint` should succeed without errors.

## Development Focus Ordering

1. Focus on the intent of the role in `meta/main.yml`.
2. Focus on user variables, defined in `defaults/main.yml`.
3. Focus on role variables, defined in `vars/main.yml`.
4. Focus on tasks, templates, and files.

## Meta (`meta/main.yml`)

- The `galaxy_info.description` captures the intent of the role.
- The file `meta/main.yml` is used to generate many other files using [Ansible Generator](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-generator).
- **Don't** use `dependencies`: This may surprise a user with extra roles being downloaded and executed.
- Distributions mentioned are tested using Molecule.

## User Variables (`defaults/main.yml`)

- The user will need to adjust these settings, so making life easier in this file is helpful.
- Variables must start with the name of the role. For example: the role `ansible-role-xyz` should have `xyz_` prepended to its variables. The intent is to limit variable bleeding and help a user understand where a variable is applicable.
- Carefully consider if a variable is a string, integer, boolean, list, or map. Changing a variable type later can be difficult for users.
- Above the variable, in comment style, describe the behaviour of the variable.

## Role Variables (`vars/main.yml`)

- The file `vars/main.yml` is used to determine or set "internal variables". The user should not be interested in these variables, as they are difficult to overwrite.
- Determining a variable for a value can be done using lookup maps:

    ```yaml
    _xyz_packages:
      default:
        - foo
        - bar
      Suse:
        - foobar

    xyz_packages: "{{ _xyz_packages[ansible_os_family] | default(_xyz_packages['default']) }}"
    ```

    This pattern can be used for all kinds of things, such as:

    1. Packages
    2. Service names
    3. Users and groups
    4. Logic (tasks/main.yml)

- In the name: line of a task, describe the intent of the task. That may differ slightly from what the task is doing. For example:

    ```yaml
    # Describes the intent of a task (strong)
    - name: Configure xyz

    # Describes what the task does (weak)
    - name: Place xyz.conf
    ```

- Spread lines vertically as much as possible to increase readability. For example:

    ```yaml
    # Easy to read (vertical)
    - name: Do something
      ansible.builtin.file:
        src: foo
        dest: /foo
      when:
        - xyz
      failed_when:
        - xyz == "xyz"
      notify:
        - XYZ Handler

    # Difficult to read (horizontal)
    - name: Do something
      ansible.builtin.file:
        src: foo
        dest: /foo
      when: xyz
      failed_when: xyz == "xyz"
      notify: XYZ Handler
    ```

    An added benefit is that it's very obvious that when, failed_when, changed_when, and handlers are actually (AND) lists.

- Never use equal signs (=) where colons (:) are possible.
- Never use Jinja in tasks or handlers. Instead, use a mapping in vars/main.yml to determine a value.
- Try to resolve values in vars/main.yml to prevent unnecessary when conditions.
- Prefer modules over `ansible.builtin.shell` and `ansible.builtin.command`.
- Packages should not use `latest` as a version, unless the role is intended to update the package.
- The `ansible.builtin.file` should mention an `owner`, `group`, and `mode`.
- Use FQCNs for modules.
- Used collections should be mentioned in the role `requirements.txt`.
- Test all variables mentioned in `defaults/main.yml` using `ansible.builtin.assert` in `tasks/assert.yml`.
- Fail as fast as possible, using `meta/argument_specs.yml` and `tasks/assert.yml`.
- Avoid using `ansible.builtin.set_fact`.
- For error-handling, prefer `block` and `rescue`.
- `failed_when: true` is never preferred, just as `ignore_errors: true`.
- Only use `gather_facts: true` when the facts are required.

## Handlers

- Don't use the listen directive.

## Templates

- Use `{{ ansible_managed | comment }}` (with the correct comment style)at the top of templates.
- Although difficult, try to prevent using Jinja. There are exceptions to this rule.

## Files

- Itâ€™s nearly always beneficial to use templates. Exceptions are:

    1. Binary files (keep in mind: Ansible is not a packaging solution).

## Molecule

- The `molecule/default/verify.yml` should test the intent of the role. This can mean: to test if a port is open, to test if an installed softwareproduct can show a version number, etc.
